## AirBnB Fair Valuation and Property Rate Recommendation Model

By analyzing Airbnb listings data in Australia, I will be creating a fair valuation model. This model will evaluate a property and suggest a fair value for listing it on Airbnb. This model can also serve as a recommendation model for prospective hosts to charge a competitive daily accomodation rate for their property.

This model will then be used to set a competitive daily accommodation rate for a client's house in Bondi Beach. The owner currently charges $50. The house has the following characteristics and constraints:

*The owner has been a host since August 2010
*The location is lon:151.274506, lat:33.889087
*The current review score rating 95.0
*Number of reviews 53
*Minimum nights 4
*The house can accomodate 10 people.
*The owner currently charges a cleaning fee of 370
*The house has 3 bathrooms, 5 bedrooms, 7 beds.
*The house is available for 255 of the next 365 days
*The client is verified, and they are a superhost.
*The cancelation policy is strict with a 14 days grace period.
*The host requires a security deposit of $1,500
*All values strictly apply to the month of July 2018
